# TODO 

- Understand the Pointer Network model 
- Prepare a presentation about Building-GAN

- Start playing with the code, load the dataset and try to manipulate the data
- Find a solution how to visualize the voxel graphs (so we can compare our works to the Building-GAN results)
- Prepare the code to run training on the laboratory once we will be back 
- Try to integrate the suggestions that the authors of Building-GAN has proposed
- Think about other problems and how can we solve them


+ Find a solution how to implement the idea that I have about Text-to-Graph generator
